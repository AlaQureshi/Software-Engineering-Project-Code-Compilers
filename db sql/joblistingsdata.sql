Company Description
Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

Job Description
As an Android engineer on the Restaurants team, you’ll work closely with other engineers as well as your designer and product manager to develop and maintain beautiful software on our own custom hardware. You’ll also be joining Square’s vibrant global community of Android engineers, with a robust open source presence and culture of learning and teaching.

You will:
- Design and build robust, scalable client software
- Lead complex cross-functional initiatives, often across team boundaries
- Collaborate closely with product managers, designers, and other engineers
- Mentor and learn from other engineers
- Participate in the full lifecycle of product development, from early definition through release and beyond
- Bring industry-advancing technology to restaurant owners internationally!

Qualifications
What you bring to the team and to Square:
- Motivation to build beautiful, intuitive products for the food and drink hospitality industry
- Ability to mentor other engineers and help teams level up
- Empathy for your customers and colleagues
- Eagerness to share your own ideas, and openness to those of others
- Experience developing, shipping, and maintaining Android apps (Kotlin and/or Java)
- 5+ years experience in software development

Technologies we use and teach:
- Kotlin for development, leveraging Square’s modern open source library, Workflow
- Espresso and snapshot testing
- Protocol buffers for network transport
- Gradle for our build environment
- Also exposure to RXJava, Dagger, Anvil, LeakCanary, and more

Who We Are:
theCoderSchool is an after-school drop-off program for kids learning to code. We provide a fun, energetic, and inspirational environment to bring out that inner hacker in all kids! The future will be ever more dependent on technology so let''s get our young generation ready. Learn to Code, Change the World.

Job Summary:
We’ve found that some students are only comfortable taking sessions in-person so the applicant will need to be able to come into our school to teach as well as online. We’re taking all necessary safety precautions during this time of Covid-19!
theCoderSchool is looking for passionate Code Coaches to teach our next generation how to change the world! You will meet incredible kids, teach them how to code - and how to think like a coder - and be rewarded with an amazing experience. This is a part-time position for anywhere from 6-25 hours/week (same times weekly), depending on your schedule and availability. These hours can generally be sometime between 3-8pm weekdays or 10-3pm on Saturday''s.

Responsibilities:
A Code Coach is a mentor who teaches kids how to code. At theCoderSchool, we have three basic teaching styles - your assignment will depend on schedule, ability, and desire.

1. Code Coaching - Private and Semi-Private Tutoring. One-on-one or one-on-two coding lessons for kids. Younger kids will be taught in Scratch or Snap, while older kids gravitate towards Python/Javascript or other advanced languages like Java, C++. The kids will generally create apps that you decide with them, and generally follow our curriculums.

2. Code Coaching PLUS. Our more experienced Code Coaches will manage a team of kids who will collaborate to create a complex app together. Requirements, design, iterations - similar to a real development but with more fun team challenges and activities mixed in.

3. Code Class. Traditional curriculum based classes with a larger student to teacher ratio, where all students follow a set specific curriculum.

This position rocks because you will:
Meet, mentor, and grow amazing kids who are ready to be our next generation of coders!
Meet and communicate with parents - many of whom will be techies themselves, who work at some of the best companies and startups in the Atlanta area.
Give back to the community and help grow our next generation by sharing your knowledge of technology
Have the flexibility to teach what you''re most comfortable with, and learn new things along the way

Requirements:
What do we want from you? Read on.
PASSION. All caps! This is all about giving back to the kids. We need to see goose bumps when your student ROCKS a code challenge.
Great Communicator. There will be plenty of chatting with parents, and of course patience is a virtue when it comes to kids!
Street Cred. Our college-level Code Coaches will have Comp Sci or Engineering or similar major at a nearby accredited school. Our Veteran Code Coaches will have relevant industry experience.
Coding Skills. Strong grasp of general technologies, proficient coder and uber-logical thinker. General knowledge of popular languages with hands on skills in a few is required - Javascript, Python, HTML/CSS, Java, C++ are most helpful. Deep technical skills aren''t required - we prefer you communicate well and find answers along with students than know everything upfront.

Sound awesome? Apply now if you''re interested!
